# miden-tutorials

The goal of this repository is to provide clear and practical examples for interacting with the **Miden Rollup**. These examples are designed to ensure a smooth onboarding experience for developers exploring Miden's capabilities.

This repository is organized into several parts:

1. **book** - contains the mdBook for the tutorials and guides.
2. **node** - contains the necessary config files for running the miden-node locally.
3. **rust-client** - contains examples for interacting with the Miden Rollup using **Rust**. 
4. **web-client** - contains examples for interacting with the Miden Rollup in the browser.
